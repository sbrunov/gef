!!! WARNING !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is an UNSTABLE version of GEF.  The current version of GEF is
embedded in ArgoUML v.07 (http://argouml.tigris.org).

The last independent GEF distribution was v.06, and is considerably
out of date.  The immediate goal for development on this version is
to separate GEF code from ArgoUML once again and produce a current,
independent GEF distribution.


Notes on the distribution:

03/02/2000:

This is an initial split of the GEF source from the ArgoUML
distribution, based on code checked out of the argouml repository on
cvs.tigris.org at noon today, EST.

src - GEF source
demos - GEF demos
docs - Old documentation
argo - The leftover ArgoUML source after GEF has been removed.
       Includes a build script to build ArgoUML from the gef.jar built
       from this GEF distribution.

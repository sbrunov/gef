This is an UNSTABLE version of GEF.  The current version of GEF is
embedded in ArgoUML v.07 (http://argouml.tigris.org).

The last independent GEF distribution was v.06, and is considerably
out of date.  The immediate goal for development on this version is
to separate GEF code from ArgoUML once again and produce a current,
independent GEF distribution.


Notes on the distribution:

03/02/2000:

This is an initial split of the GEF source from the ArgoUML
distribution, based on code checked out of the argouml repository on
cvs.tigris.org at noon today, EST.

src - GEF source
demos - GEF demos
docs - Old documentation
argo - The leftover ArgoUML source after GEF has been removed.  This
       directory exists solely to help track files that are migrated
       between the ArgoUML and GEF distributions, and will be
       removed once the boundaries of the ArgoUML/GEF separation are
       settled upon.  Includes a build script to verify that ArgoUML
       can be built from the gef.jar produced by the GEF
       distribution.

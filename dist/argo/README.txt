This is NOT a release version of ArgoUML.  The contents of this
directory are what was left of ArgoUML after splitting out the GEF
code.

An ant build script is included to build ArgoUML from this source and
the gef.jar built from the GEF distribution.  The build script
requires a dev.properties file in the ANT_HOME directory which
contains the following properties:

gef.lib=path/to/gef.jar
xml4j.lib=path/to/xml4j.jar

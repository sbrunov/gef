                <td>The Graph Editing Framework is a library of Java(tm) classes 
                  that make it easier to develop new applications that involve 
                  diagram editing (ala MacDraw(tm)) and connected graph editing 
                  (something like Visio(tm)).<br>
                  <br>
                  I am making this framework availible to anyone who wants it. 
                  My hope for this project is that people around the world will 
                  be able to make use of this framework, and will contribute comments 
                  and enhancements. I think that the design is clear enough and 
                  extensible enough that people will be able to add new Cmds, 
                  Figs, Modes, Palettes, Layers, etc. without having to do much 
                  integration work.<br>
                  <br>
                  When I initially announced that I was doing this project, I 
                  got several favorable responses from people who were implementing 
                  applications for their companies that needed diagram editing, 
                  as well as students and instructors who wanted material for 
                  project classes.<b><br>
                  <br>
                  </b>GEF can be used to for both applications and applets. Although, 
                  some features (e.g., saving files) are only available in applications.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am very interested in working with instructors who would like 
                  to give this code to students, and with students working on 
                  projects. GEF was initially developed by undergraduates working 
                  on a class project. Now, GEF has been downloaded over 500 times 
                  by people around the world.</td>

			easier to develop new applications that involve diagram editing (ala MacDraw(tm)) and connected graph editing (something
			like Visio(tm)). Below is a screenshot of this type of application. In the screenshot, the user is looking at two
			views of the same diagram.<BR>
			<BR>
			I am making this framework availible to anyone who wants it. My hope for this project is that people around the
			world will be able to make use of this framework, and will contribute comments and enhancements. I think that the
			design is clear enough and extensible enough that people will be able to add new Actions, Figs, Modes, Palettes,
			Layers, etc. without having to do a much integration work.<BR>
			<BR>
			When I initially announced that I was doing this project, I got several favorable responses from people who were
			implementing applications for their companies that needed diagram editing, as well as students and instructors
			who wanted material for project classes.</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma"><B><BR>

			</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">GEF can be used to for both applications and applets. Although,
			some features (e.g., saving files) are only available in applications.<BR>
			<BR>
			I am very interested in working with instructors who would like to give this code to students, and with students
			working on projects. GEF was initially developed by undergraduates working on a class project. Now, GEF has been
			downloaded over 500 times by people around the world.</FONT></TD>

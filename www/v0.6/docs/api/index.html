GEF v0.6 Package Overview

<h2> Packages </h2>
<ul>
<li> <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.gef</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.gef.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
 
The vast majority of the GEF code. This includes
the classes JGraph, Editor, Fig, Selection, Layer, Guide,
Mode, Cmd, NetPrimitive.

<li> <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.gef.event</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.gef.event.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
 
Classes that implement GraphSelectionEvents.  Currently GEF only
defines one new kind of event.  All other events are done using
PropertyChangeEvents.

<li> <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.gef.demo</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.gef.demo.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
 
Classes that demonstrate how to use GEF to build applications and
applets. This directory also includes HTML files for the demos that
you see on this web site. Start here to check out what GEF can do, to
make sure you have everything installed and working, and as a starting
point for building your own programs.

<li> <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.graph</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.graph.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
 
Interfaces and default classes for representing connected graphs.
Like Swing widgets, GEF allows you to use your own
application-specific objects to represent connected graphs.  You must
simply implement a GraphModel to give GEF access to your objects.

<li>  <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.ui</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.ui.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>

User interface code that is used by GEF but could also be used for
other purposes.  This includes TabPropFrame and Toolbar.


<li>  <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.util</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.util.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>

Utility classes that are used by GEF but could also be used for other
purposes. This includes preloading classes, a progress bar window,
predicate objects, and some data structures.

<li>  <B><font size=+2 color="006600">uci.beans.editors</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-uci.beans.editors.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
JavaBeans(tm) style property editors and associated classes for the
property sheet. Currently editors are defined for Colors and Rectangles.


</ul>

Note that all "javadocs" were actually produced with the <a
href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~tgee/polardoc/">polardoc</a> utility.
Also note that all class names are links to the appropriate class,
even if the class name does not appear underlined in your browser.

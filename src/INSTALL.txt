Installing GEF
--------------

!!! WARNING !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is an UNSTABLE version of GEF.  See README.txt for details. If
you want to try building the installation anyway, read on.  You have
been warned.


The distribution is built using the Ant build system
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  Once you have Ant installed, you can
build the distribution simply by executing the command:

  ant

Ant operates similarly to make, but instead of a makefile, Ant uses an
XML build file.  The build.xml file for this distribution has the
following targets:

  ant build - compiles source files into gef/lib.  this is the default
              target.
  ant jar - creates gef.jar
  ant javadoc - creates javadoc documentation in docs/javadoc
  ant clean - deletes compiled classes and jar files.

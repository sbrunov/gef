Installing GEF
--------------


last revised: 28th June 2003


This version is in transition. Major design changes are expected
within the next months (shouldn't take until 2004). So please
bear in mind that when you use this version before the design
change is finished you have to redesign your usage of the GEF
library in the future. Waiting for the design change or participating
in it is highly recommended before making extensive use of GEF.


Installing on Windows:

Go to the src directory and invoke "build.bat".


Installing on Linux / Unix systems:

Go to the src directory and type "sh build.sh".



Troubleshooting:

If any errors occure make sure that all libraries are in place
as they are needed. Look into build.bat / build.sh to find out
what libraries are needed.

You have to have set the JAVA_HOME variable correctly. Please make
sure this is the case. Use "set JAVA_HOME=<path_to_your_java>" or
"export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_your_java>" to set it correctly.

Please also make sure that you have set up your java environment
correctly. Maybe you have to go to http://java.sun.com and download
a new version.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! WARNING !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is an UNSTABLE version of GEF.  See README.txt for details. If
you want to try building the installation anyway, read on.  You have
been warned.


First, you have to unzip the gef archive to a directory of your choice.
It is recommended, that the last part of the resulting path is a
subdirectory called "src". If you use another name for the subdirectory
the build process might fail.

The distribution is built using the Ant build system
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  You will need to have Ant 1.2+.
Once you have Ant installed, you can build the distribution simply
by executing the command:

  ant compile

This will compile all needed source files and copy the necessary helper
files to the build directory. If you plan to use GEF as part of other
projects, you might to build a jar file. Therefore you need to create a
directory called "lib" on the same level your "src"-directory is on. Then
simply type

  ant package

This will do all the things "ant compile" does and additionally build a
jar file called "gef.jar" in your "lib"-directory.

Ant operates similarly to make, but instead of a makefile, Ant uses an
XML build file.  The build.xml file for this distribution has the
several targets. You can type

  ant

to get a list of the currently available targets including a short
description of them.

THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THORSTEN STURM AND MERGED INTO THE
BRANCH GENTLEWARE CHANGES.



Description of the changes to GEF represented in this zip file
==============================================================

The changes are not directly commited to GEF, because they break some of the
functionality provided for ArgoUML. So, this zip file simply is a collection 
of the changed files. The changes in itself should work out fine. They work 
within GEF (using BasicApplication) and in conjunction with Poseidon, but are
tested completely outside of Poseidon.

1. Major changes that may break functionality in using applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------

+ enhanced the compatibility of GEF with both, JDK 1.3 and 1.4. E.g. fixes 
  problems occuring with the usage of intersects() or the visibility of
  horizontal lines.
  
+ allows for opening multiple text editors instead of just one.

+ each Diagram has its own scale factor (instead of the Editor holding only one).

+ change the type of some collections from Vector to List for performance reasons.

+ leave all ongoing modes when changing the diagram or pressing ESC.

+ enable popup  menus for multiple selections.

+ add accessors for a number of internal attributes to enhance e.g. cut-copy-paste
  behavior.
  
+ fixed handling of removed enclosed figs.

+ fixed concurrency problems.



2. Changes made to GEF that shouldn't break functionality
---------------------------------------------------------

+ use the correct drawing area for printing

+ fix some memory leaks (esp. regarding to listener handling).

+ fix some redraw problems.

+ performance fixes.

+ fix some problems regarding zooming

+ fix bugs in SVG export (drawing of polygons, filled nodes).

+ fix drawing bug for filled circles or those having dashed borders.

+ fix behavior of buttons added to the Toolbar with a Component (not an action).

+ better handling of possible loading errors to make PGML loading more robust.

+ fix behavior of the broom tool (it will no longer wipe elements irrecoverable from
  the diagram)



3. Functional changes that may need adjustment in using applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The zooming features of GEF have been reworked. Although it should still work, we
stopped using CmdZoom and handle the zooming factor based on actions. The scale factor
itself is no longer held by the Editor, but by each Diagram separately. Changing the
visible Diagram also changes the scale factor set for the editor. The translation of
mouse positions has been optimized and should work smooth now.



4. Summary
----------

A number of files contained in this zip files have been changed only according to signature 
changes in other classes. We stayed away from deprecating the older signatures for making
sure to catch and change all appearances of it, either in GEF or in Poseidon. Some of the
changes have been highly influenced by our own needs, e.g. changes in zooming, handling of
popup menus and more.Esp. the ArgoUML people should test carefully which of the changes break
functionality.

Due to time constraints and the number of changes and commits we made to our internal GEF
repository, there is no detailed description of individual changes and the files affected by
it (that's why the zip file and this description is build).

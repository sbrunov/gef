!!! WARNING !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is an UNSTABLE version of GEF. It is meant for development issues only.
Do yourself a favor and use a stable version for your all day work.

Notes on the distribution:

There has been some bugfixing only since the last development release of GEF.
SVG support is added but not yet tested very well, so you better use PGML.

Please read the INSTALL.txt file for info on how to build GEF.
